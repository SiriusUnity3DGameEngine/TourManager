# TourManager
A embedded webapp for editing *.tour files for Mobile VR Station

This is very basic at the moment, it only supports loading in the *.tour folders and viewing it's information, rooms and points.

#Current Goals
- Add Room/Point
- Generate preview images
- WebGl Point Preview
- Validate on client/server side
- Save changes back to local file system

#Concerns
- Don't allow this app onto the internet, it's built for localhost development and currently doesn't have any security
